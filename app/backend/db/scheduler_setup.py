"""Periodic schema rescans via DBMS_SCHEDULER. Mirrors notebook §12.

Two pieces:

  1. `scan_history` table — bookkeeping for every scan the agent has run.
     Created idempotently on app boot. The §5 scanner writes a row when
     it starts/finishes a scan.

  2. (opt-in) A `DBMS_SCHEDULER` job that calls a tiny PL/SQL procedure to
     enqueue a scan request — the harness, when running, drains queued rows
     and runs `run_scan(owner)` on each. This keeps the cron in the database
     (so it survives kernel restarts) while keeping the actual scan logic in
     Python.

Opt in by setting SCAN_INTERVAL_MIN in the env (e.g. SCAN_INTERVAL_MIN=60).
With the variable unset (the default), no scheduler job is created.
