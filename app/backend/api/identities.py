"""Identity registry for the "Use As:" selector.

The AGENT database user is always the actual session principal. Identities here
are *application-layer personas* layered on top: each one carries a clearance
level, a list of authorized regions (AMERICAS / EUROPE / MIDDLE_EAST /
ASIA_PACIFIC), and a set of columns that should be masked when read.

This module is the **single source of truth** for those rules. It is consumed
by:

  * `api/data_routes.py` and `agent/tools.py` — which push the persona into the
    database session via `db/deep_security.py` before every read, so the kernel
    enforces the rules, and keep the Python filters as defence in depth.
  * `scripts/setup_deep_security.py` — which projects the same registry into
    either Oracle Deep Data Security data grants (26ai Enterprise-class) or
    `DBMS_RLS` policies driven by the `EDA_CTX` application context (26ai Free,
    which is what the shipped Codespace runs).

So there are two enforcement layers, and they cannot disagree: both are derived
from the data below. See `docs/part-8-deep-data-security.md` and Part 8 of
`enterprise_data_agent.ipynb`.

Personas in this file are tuned so that *every* commonly-viewed table changes
visibly when you switch identities. That makes the security model legible at a
glance: pick `agent` and you see masks; pick `cfo` and they vanish; pick a
regional analyst and rows drop too. Only `compliance.officer` can read the
SAR_REPORTS table.

NOTE: every entry in `mask_cols` must name a column that actually exists. A
mask naming a nonexistent column is a silent no-op in Python and an ORA-23607
the moment it reaches the database; this file previously shipped
`FINANCE.ACCOUNTS.ACCOUNT_NUMBER`, which never existed.
